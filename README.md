# CS-340-Client-Server-Development Portfolio Reflection

    When I build programs, I try to keep the code clean, organized and easy to understand later. One thing that really helped in this class was the CRUD Python module from Project One. I set it up so each function had one simple job, and I added just enough comments so I would remember what everything did. Because of that, I was able to plug the same module straightn into my Project Two dashboard. I did not have to rewrite all the database code again. That saves time and avoids mistakes. I could reuse this CRUD module in any future project that needs to read or write data in the same MongoDB database, or even in a completely new interface if I wanted to.
    When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I usually break it down into smaller steps and focus on what the user actually needs. For Grazioso Salvare, I looked at what they needed to filter, how they needed the dashboard to behave, and what parts of the database mattered most. This felt a lot more like a real job compared to earlier assignments, where everything was already spelled out. Going forward, I plan to keep using this method. Start by understanding what the client does, build the database and code in a flexible way, and test as I go to make sure everything lines up with their goals.
    Computer scientists help people work smarter by organizing data and automating the things that would take too long to do by hand. This kind of dashboard can help a company like Grazioso Salvare quickly find the right animals for special training. That can save time, reduce errors, and make the whole process smoother. It matters because technology can support real missions and make a positive impact, not just sit in a code editor.
